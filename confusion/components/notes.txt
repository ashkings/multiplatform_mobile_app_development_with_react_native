Actions in Redux
-----------------
Simply put, actions are events. They are the only way you can send data from your application to your Redux 
store. The data can be from user interactions, API calls or even form submission.

Actions are sent using store.dispatch() method. Actions are plain JavaScript objects and they must have a type 
property to indicate the type of action to be carried out. They must also have a payload that contains the 
information that should be worked on by the action. Actions are created via an action creator.



Reducers in Redux
-----------------

Reducers are pure functions that take the current state of an application, perform an action and returns a 
new state. These states are stored as objects and they specify how the state of an application changes in 
response to an action sent to the store.

It is based on the reduce function in JavaScript where a single value is gotten from multiple values after a 
callback function has carried out.


Store in Redux
--------------

The store holds the application state. There is only one store in any Redux application. You can access the 
state stored, update the state, and register or unregister listeners via helper methods.
